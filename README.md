### Project Title
Rabbit Hope

### Description
For this project, I have built a complete project under the theme: Emotion!

The task was to create an experience that makes someone feel an emotion, whether that be fear, sadness, or joy! I opted for fear and joy in the life of rabbits.

I started by planning all of the tasks I wanted to complete in a Pre-Production document. After I completed the pre-production document, I realized that there were tasks that are too complicated or could be achieved by similar means. At that time, I carried out a scope reduction on my pre-production document.

Both of these tasks – the creation of the Pre-Production document and it’s re-visitation to reduce the scope helped immensely to refocus on the tasks that were achievable with the knowledge I had or some further study as I  headed into development.

My Pre-Production document is included in the repository .
